macroize many magic board specific params into conf file:
	 LED Pin
	 USB Disc Pin
	 Default Usr Flash/Ram prog location

Adjust what DFU alternate configs are available:
     1) Usercode -> default RAM loc (must match linker script from build env)
     2) Usercode -> default FLASH loc (must match linker script from build env)
     3) Usercode -> .maple format, includes metadata about where to put what (ala IHex)

Build an interactive supervisor:
     1) Serial/virtual serial debug (r/w reg/ram/flash)
     2) offer hooks to usercode to modify conf regs or vector table

Grow interactive supervisor into an actual privileged kernel:
     1) mediates all direct cong register access
     2) provides stock means for handling exceptions
     3) provides stock interactive debug interface
     4) principly owns FLASH, USB, location of vector table, exception handlers, clocks, system pins (usb disc)
     5) everything else can probably be directly modded by usercode
     6) potentially manage power/standby modes

Provide stronger hooks between Makefile and preproc:
    1) strictly define stack ptr addr, user stack, usr code loc, vector table addr, stack size, etc.
